The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox.

Vote for ZAP in the [Toolswatch Top Security Tools of 2015](https://www.toolswatch.org/2015/11/vote-for-2015-best-security-tool/) survey.

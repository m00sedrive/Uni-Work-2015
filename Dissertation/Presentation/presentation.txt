1. Welcome and good morning to my dissertation project demonstration.
	
	- My dissertation project was to developed as a proof of concept of a face authentication system.
	
	- The main features algorithmic features of the project are face detection and user verification
	
	- The sytem hs been developed in java cv which is a ported version of the OpenCV library natively written in C++
	
2. System hosts 3 main interfaces, login, custom database design and traing database interface

3. A user will initally login using a username password so that can create, load or train a dataset

4. demo of create database, Explain Haar-like feature extraction and success rates of face detection.

5. training interface.
 - filepath has been coded to a small sample set of the xm2vs database provided by Surrey uni for the demo.
 - the system has been tested on both the AT&T database compliments of the cambridge university comp labs and XM2VS db from surrey uni

6. train datbase
	
	- main algorithmic feature is the linear detection algorthm PCA used to to calculate eigenDecomposition.
	- as image analysis is a demanding computational process in regards to face recognition PCA seeks to optimise the representation of data.
	- essentially this is done by:
		- data to be normalized to standardize data.
		- produce covariance matrix
		- calculate eigen vectors and corresponding values
	- eigen vectors represent the direction of principal components and the values rep the variances of data in that direction
	- vectors with the least values are removed to potimise data representation

7. write database 
- The PCA computation results are serialized and saved to file so that a known user can authentiate a the log in screen without having to initially train the DB.

8. return to login screen and demomstrate authentication

10. on main screen demostrate spoofing:
	- display spoofing and explain why this system if security is paramount should only be used to compliment an existing authentication system.
	- this can be prevented by implementing liveness detection which is becoming a common practice for face authentication systems be delivered today.

9. Here is an extract from the complimentary final report that illustares the systems workflow to better visualize the applications purpose


Thank you for your time. Could i answer any questions?
Please dont hurt me!!!!
